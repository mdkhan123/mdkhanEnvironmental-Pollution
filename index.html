        <p>I choose a topic which is Environmental Pollution. Bad Pollution destroying our world. There have Air Pollution, Land Pollution, and Water Pollution. Air Pollution contain chemicals in the air that can harm the health of human, plant, and animals. We can see air pollution coming from cars, buses, planes, trucks, trains, power plants, oil refineries, industrial facilities, and factories. Those things make air pollution in our world. Land pollution is a serious problem impact on human and many other species, and animals. Many people throw garbage on the street, house corner. It makes our environmental diseases. And Water pollution bad for humans, sea animals. Those things make us sick and we have a serious problem. I choose this because I went to showpeople, how Environmental Pollution affects us. It is time to stop to throw garbage to the street, etc.

         <p>I chose two different software to make the video which is Adobe After Effect and Adobe Illustrator.  First I use Adobe Illustrator to the created object, like earth, cars, trees, etc. Cars I created because I like to show that, where is air pollution comes from.  After that, I use Adobe After Effect to animate those objects that I create on Illustrator. In After Effect I created smoke and some shape layer, like sun, the color of the sky, mountain, etc. My challenge part to think the story and imagine the story that what object do I need to make the videos. I enjoy doing it. I spend most of the time to create this animation video.
